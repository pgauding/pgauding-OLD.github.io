# About

I am a PhD candidate in political science at the University of Kansas,
with focuses in American politics, public policy and administration,
and quantitative methods.

My main interests lie at the intersection of local government,
criminal justice. My dissertation research focuses on how local governments utilize
alternative sentencing mechanisms as instruments of criminal justice
reform, financial restraint, and/or revenue generation. Specifically,
I aim to describe and explain financial and public opinion reasons why
elected officials and bureaucrats choose to implement criminal
diversion programs (or not), and how these programs are used to
either give defendants a "second chance", or to exploit defendants for
financial gain. I utilize a unique survey experiment, 

I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I completed my undergraduate and
master's degrees at the University of Cincinnati.

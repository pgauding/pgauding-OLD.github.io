I am a PhD candidate in political science at the University of
Kansas. I conduct research on local government and criminal justice
reform by investigating the motivations for and mechanisms to
implementing alternative sentencing schemes, such as criminal
diversion programs. I also teach courses in American politics and
public policy at the University of Kansas and Kansas State University.
